ember-cordova is a CLI/Addon for building native mobile applications with Ember.

Once [installed](pages/installation), building is as simple as:

```
ember cdv:build --platform=ios
```

The project includes [on-device livereload](pages/workflow/livereload), a [CLI](pages/cli) for building & deploying to devices, automated [icon/splash generation](pages/workflow/icon_splash_management), a [device info service](pages/service_platform) and a growing ecosystem of plugins.

ember-cordova maintained by [Isle of Code](https://isleofcode.com) in Toronto, with a community of contributors.
